Assignment for the week.

1. Write a python program that will create the file hello.txt
   with several lines of plain text in the file.
2. Write a python program that will dump the contents of the file
   hello.txt to the file stdout (the terminal screen).  If you
   google "python file io" you should find examples of how to write
   the code.  You could even "cheat" and call a unix shell program
   from python to dump the file.
3. Write a Makefile with a check target that will run the python
   program that creates hello.txt.  Don't forget the TAB character
   that MUST appear before the line that runs your python program.
   Something like

        TAB python your_program

4. Commit your files to the directory week_4 in your repository and
   push the changes to your shared repository at github.com.
